### Hard skills
• Good command of JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML hypertext markup language, CSS style sheet language.

```JavaScript
import React from 'react';

 create sequence hibernate_sequence start with 1 increment by 1;

 create table matrix_types
  (
    id   int8 identity,
    name varchar(255) unique,
    primary key (id)
  );

 create table matrices
  (
    id     int8 not null,
    type   int8 references matrix_types(id),
    size   int4,
    serial varchar(255),
    number int4,
    visible boolean default(false),
    primary key (id)
  );

 create table baked_frames
  (
    id int8 identity,
    timestamp timestamp not null,
    matrix_id int8 not null references matrices (id),
    baking_time_1 time not null,

### Work experience

There is no large commercial development experience (I made a couple of sites on Wordpress, made minor edits to the application on React.js)

At the moment I am finishing my studies at it-incubator.by and started a course on JavaScript on the RS School platform,  read articles on https://learn.javascript.ru

I practice the acquired knowledge on educational projects, solve tasks at https://www.codewars.com
